> **ðŸ“– [The Observer Pattern](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk3/04-Observer-Pattern)**

## Questions

1. What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?

The Observer pattern addresses the following problems: A one-to-many dependency between objects should be defined without making the objects tightly coupled. It should be ensured that when one object changes state, an open-ended number of dependent objects are updated automatically.

2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

the subscribe method.

the unsubscribe method.

the broadcast method.


3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom. 

actually i really dont understand how these things communicate 

but if i had to use logic i would say it using the event of subscribe and broadcast to keep things updated in the appstate
