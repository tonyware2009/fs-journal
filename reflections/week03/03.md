## Questions

1. What are the two common operations that we will set in the handler?

The get operator takes two parameters â€” the object itself and the property being accessed

The set operator takes three arguments â€” the object, the property being accessed and the value being set for that property.


2. What do you have to make sure you are doing with every Get to ensure the value does not become `undefined`?

you must use the get operator to access the value otherwise the .log will come back as undefined.

3. What are some of the benefits of the proxy object that we are using in our structure for applications?

Proxy is a structural design pattern that lets you provide a substitute or placeholder for another object. A proxy controls access to the original object, allowing you to perform something either before or after the request gets through to the original object.
