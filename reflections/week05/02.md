## Questions

1. What are the three types of relationships?

one to one

one to many

many to many

2. What are the benefits of the traditional `linking` of relationships instead of `Embedding`

The strength of embedding the Address document directly in the User document is that we can retrieve the user and its addresses in a single read operation versus having to first read the user document and then the address documents for that specific user

linking has something todo with foreign keys that makes it better then straight embedding

3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it? 

the challenges would be depending on the subject or how many different people are creating the same thing 
i would try to see a pattern of one pice of data that has been created by many people.
