## Questions

1. What does REST stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean?

REST stands for representational state transfer

REST defines a set of constraints for how the architecture of an Internet-scale distributed hypermedia system, such as the Web, should behave.

2. What does Stateless mean?

Statelessness means that every HTTP request happens in complete isolation. 
When the client makes an HTTP request, it includes all information necessary for the server to fulfill the request. 
The server never relies on information from previous requests from the client

3. What URL pattern is used when writing a RESTful API?

 URLs should include nouns, not verbs. Use plural nouns only for consistency (no singular nouns).
